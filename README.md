# Solutions for java-programming-i mooc.fi

This repository contains my solutions for the `Java Programming I` course offered at [mooc.fi](https://www.mooc.fi/en/). The course focuses on the basics of the Java programming language, including variables, conditional statements, loops, arrays, methods, and the basics of object-oriented programming.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to document the code examples and solutions I've written during the course, and to provide a reference for other learners taking the course.

## How to Use

The files in the repository are organized according to the parts of the course and the exercises within those parts. Each directory contains code files with solutions to the exercises for that part.
